I used the covid-19-data/public/data dataset at master - owid/covid-19-data, within which I find information collected within Our World in Data in order to conduct an in-depth investigation of:
- Confirmed cases and deaths
- Hospitalizations and intensive care unit ICU admissions
- Testing 
- Covid-19 vaccines
